        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi everyone, my name is Shuhena Begum. My birthday is in February 7 <sup>th</sup>. I am 21 years old. I'm currently a senior at Wayne State University majoring in Computer Science. My hobbies are reading books and watching Korean or Chinese dramas. </p>
        <p>I decided to go to <abbr title="Wayne State University">WSU</abbr> because it was close to my house and I wanted to be close to my family.</p>
        <p title="My courses">Below are the list of classes I'm taking this semester:</p>
        <ol>    
        <li>Principles of Web Technology</li>

        <li>Programing Languages</li>
        <li>Fitness Basics</li>

        <p>I'm taking the courses Fitness Basics and Healthy Lifestyle Basics because I want to be able to drink more water (H <sub>2</sub> O) since I don't drink enough water for a day. </p>
